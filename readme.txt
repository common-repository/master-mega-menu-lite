== IMPORTANT NOTES ==
* **Master Mega menu is a standalone Plugin, it's included with our Core plugin [Master Addons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/master-addons/)**
* **Master Mega menu for Elementor will not automatically adopt the style of your theme**, unless your theme has dependency stylesheet for Master Mega Menu. You‚Äôll need to customize the styles on your own to recreate it if that‚Äôs what you want.
* Please DO NOT ask for making this plugin to work with **Elementor Pro's Nav Menu** Widget!
* The **Elementor Pro's Nav Menu** widget is not designed for mega menus. We also SHOULD NOT override behaviors of Elementor Pro widgets. Master Mega Menu has its own widgets and behaviors.
